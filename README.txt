Dicky's Portion:
html folder - dummy html that i used to test login/signup page
app_d.js - server code to handle login/signup page
	Includes:
		- adding account to database
		- authentication (work in progress)
dicky.json - only important part are the dependencies. made this file to prevent merge conflicts with 		     others

Ideally, we want the browser to alert the user about unsuccessful logins/signups which is done in a script using the alert function to pop-up a window in the browser. It's fine as it is but there's no warning as to why the user gets redirected to the same page.
