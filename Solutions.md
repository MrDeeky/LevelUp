Our app is designed as a way for gamers to connect with each other and join groups for the games they enjoy playing so that they can chat and play together. Currently implemented is: the home page, which will display popular multiplayer games and allow users to choose a game and be directed to a page which shows a description for that game; a groups page; a login page; and a signup page.

The app is supposed to work as follows: a user will go onto the website and on the home page will be various popular multiplayer games (these images of the games are loaded from the GiantBomb API, which is why there is a delay); then the user can select a game and see the description page created for that game; in the groups page, each group will have a name, a short description, and some general requirements of the group in its listing; a user can see all the existing groups by clicking on the tab at the top of the page; the groups are organized by game and a user can create a group for a game or join an existing group for a specific game: in the group users will be able to talk to other users who are also in that group for a specific game.
